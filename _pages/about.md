I'm a Machine Learning Software Engineer @ [Alif Tech](https://aliftech.uz). I have 6+ years of
experience in developing software of various kinds - mostly, machine learning solutions. Currently
I'm working on building AI assistants for the automation of conversational experiences of our clients.
Previously, I was a Research Engineer @ [Romanovsky Institue of Mathematics](https://en.mathinst.uz)
working on adapting machine learning methods including foundational models (see, e.g.,
[`smiles-gpt`](https://sanjaradylov.github.io/publication/smiles-gpt)) and graph neural networks to
chemistry. I received my Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics & Computer Science from
[Lomonosov Moscow State University in Tashkent](https://msu.ru/en/).

I'm mostly interested in deep learning and its applications in natural language processing, esp. the
parts that make high-throughput, research-intensive solutions largely available in industry. But my
interests are not strictly limited, and some of the projects I enjoyed being involved in (albeit
shortly) are transaction fraud monitoring and credit scoring.

I try to be active on social media incl. [Medium](https://medium.com/@sshadylov),
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sshadylov), and [Github](https://github.com/sanjaradylov) by sharing
my thoughts and experiences on the field. Check out the references & pages on this website and feel
free to reach out by any means that suits you best.
