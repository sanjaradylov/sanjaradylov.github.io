The thickness of a graph `G` is the minimum number of planar graphs whose union is `G`. In this paper, we consider an upper bound for the chromatic number of graphs depending on thickness `k` and girth `g`, where `k >= 1` and `g >= 3`. In particular, for biplanar graphs with girth at least 10 we obtain 5-colorability. [[Math-Net]](http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/ista/v22/i3/p99)
